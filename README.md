# Code-Translation
Python code that reads a file and converts the code to different programming languages using the GPT-3 API
 The converted code is then saved in separate text files for each target language.
 
 Make sure to replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual OpenAI API key. Also, update the input_file_path variable with the correct path to your input file.
Create an input.txt file in local folder and paste the required code that need to be converted.
This code will read the contents of the input.txt file, convert it to the specified target languages using the GPT-3 API, and save each converted code in separate text files with names like output_python.txt, output_c.txt, and so on.
